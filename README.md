Project files for a math modeling course.
The code here is a mix between
* ported MATLAB code 
* various coding problems/solutions

I don't provide any project specs or MATLAB code here, as I don't own them.

HOWEVER, most of the material is straightforward enough. Many of the datasets I
work with can be found at the
(UCI Machine Learning Repository)[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml].
