# 579
Project files for a math modeling course.
The code here is a mix between
* <s>ported MATLAB code</s> we MATLAB now
* various coding problems/solutions
* implementations in python

I don't provide any project specs or <s>MATLAB code here</s>, as I don't own them.
(I recieved permission to host the code for this course).

HOWEVER, most of the material is straightforward enough. Many of the datasets I
work with can be found at the
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).
